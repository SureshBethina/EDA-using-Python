# EDA-using-Python

In this Project I have analysed the Diwali sales using python.

This dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.

I have cleaned the data in first step then analysed that data using different libraries of python.

In this project I have worked with numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn.

These libraries are helpful in numberical calcualtions and data visualisations.

Using the data and after EDA, I have given some meaningful insights to increase their sales and to know which customers/occupation/ age group they need to focus to even improve their sales.

These insights were written as comments in jupyter file.
